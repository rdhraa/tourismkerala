As many as 41 rivers which rise from the western ghats, flow down to the midlands and lowlands to the west. There are a few east flowing rivers also, which are the tributaries of the Cauvery. The length of most of the rivers is extremely limited and they are monsoon-fed. Some of the rivers are Bharatapuzha, Chalakkudy, Peechi, Malampuzha, Gayatri, Walayar, Vazhani, Neyyar, Periyar, Mangalam and Cheerakuzhy.The backwaters form a specially attractive and economically valuable feature of Kerala.
